This is a common pattern for defining response DTOs.\&quot;,\&quot;/LibraryApp/src/main/java/dev/patika/LibraryApp/repository/BookRepository.java\&quot;:\&quot;This BookRepository interface defines the data access methods for the Book entity. It extends JpaRepository which provides common CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- findByNameAndAuthor(String name, Author author) - Finds an optional Book by name and author\\n- findByCategoryId(Long categoryId) - Finds a list of Books by category ID using a JPQL query\\n\\nThis is a Spring Data JPA repository interface that provides:\\n\\n- CRUD methods for the Book entity \\n- A custom method to find a Book by name and author\\n- A custom method to find Books by category ID using a JPQL query\\n\\nThe BookRepository interface defines the data access layer for the Book entity. Implementations of this interface will be auto-generated by Spring Data JPA to provide the defined methods for retrieving, updating, deleting Book objects from the database.\&quot;,\&quot;/LibraryApp/src/main/java/dev/patika/LibraryApp/entity/BookBorrowing.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines an entity class for book borrowings in a library application.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It defines a BookBorrowing entity class using JPA annotations. This maps the class to a database table.\\n\\n- It has fields for properties of a book borrowing like borrower name, email, borrowing date, return date etc. \\n\\n- The id field is the primary key and is auto-generated. \\n\\n- borrowerName, borrowerMail are defined as not nullable columns.\\n\\n- borrowingDate is defined as not nullable column. \\n\\n- returnDate can be nullable.\\n\\n- It has a ManyToOne relationship with Book entity using the book field. This allows retrieving the book details associated with a borrowing. \\n\\n- Lombok annotations are used for constructor generation and getter/setter methods.\\n\\n- This class represents a single row in the book_borrowing database table and allows performing CRUD operations on borrowings through JPA.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the entity model for a book borrowing in the database along with its relationships and properties. This enables persistence of borrowing data.\&quot;,\&quot;/LibraryApp/src/main/java/dev/patika/LibraryApp/entity/Category.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines the Category entity class for a library application.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It defines the Category entity that will be mapped to the \\\&quot;category\\\&quot; table in the database using JPA annotations.\\n\\n- The id field is the primary key and is auto-generated. \\n\\n- The name and description fields map to columns in the database table.\\n\\n- It uses Lombok annotations like @Getter, @Setter, @NoArgsConstructor to reduce boilerplate code.\\n\\n- The books field defines a many-to-many relationship with the Book entity. A category can have many books and a book can belong to many categories. \\n\\n- @JsonIgnore annotation is used to ignore the books field during JSON serialization to avoid lazy loading issues.\\n\\n- It represents a category record in the database and allows CRUD operations on categories to be performed through JPA.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the Category entity/domain model and maps it to the database table to allow persistence of category data in the library application.\&quot;,\&quot;/LibraryApp/src/main/java/dev/patika/LibraryApp/controller/BookBorrowingController.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a REST controller for book borrowing functionality.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- findAll() - Returns a list of all book borrowings\\n- getById() - Returns a book borrowing by ID \\n- save() - Saves a new book borrowing from a request object\\n- update() - Updates an existing book borrowing by ID from a request object\\n- deleteById() - Deletes a book borrowing by ID\\n\\nIt maps HTTP requests to methods on the BookBorrowingService. The controller annotations:\\n\\n- @RestController makes it a REST API controller \\n- @RequestMapping sets the base URL path\\n- @ResponseStatus sets the expected HTTP response status codes\\n\\nThe methods use request parameters (@PathVariable, @RequestBody) and return response entities. This provides the REST API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on book borrowings via the service layer.\&quot;,\&quot;/LibraryApp/src/main/java/dev/patika/LibraryApp/service/PublisherService.java\&quot;:\&quot;This PublisherService class:\\n\\n- Provides services for the Publisher entity.\\n- It is responsible for CRUD operations on publishers.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- findAll(): Returns a list of all publishers mapped to PublisherResponse DTOs.\\n\\n- getById(): Returns a publisher by id mapped to PublisherResponse DTO.

Checks if a publisher with the same name and establishment year already exists before creating. \\n\\n- update(): Updates an existing publisher. Checks if a publisher with the same name and establishment year already exists before updating. Throws error if publisher not found by id.\\n\\n- deleteById(): Deletes a publisher by id from the database. Throws error if publisher not found.\\n\\n- It uses the PublisherRepository to perform CRUD operations on the database.\\n\\n- It uses the PublisherMapper to map entities to/from DTOs for the response.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides CRUD services for the Publisher entity by delegating to the repository and mapping to/from DTOs for the response.\&quot;,\&quot;/LibraryApp/src/main/java/dev/patika/LibraryApp/entity/Book.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines the Book entity class for a library application using JPA (Java Persistence API).\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It defines the Book entity with attributes like id, name, publicationYear, stock etc. These map to columns in the database table.\\n\\n- The id field is the primary key and is auto-generated.\\n\\n- Relationships to other entities like Author, Publisher are defined using JPA annotations like @ManyToOne, @OneToMany etc. \\n\\n- @ManyToOne defines the many-to-one relationship between Book and Author/Publisher entities. \\n\\n- @OneToMany defines the one-to-many relationship between Book and BookBorrowing entities. \\n\\n- @ManyToMany defines the many-to-many relationship between Book and Category entities, with a join table to map the relationship.\\n\\n- Annotations like @Entity, @Table map the class and table in the database. \\n\\n- Getter/setter methods are auto-generated using Lombok annotations.\\n\\n- It defines the object model and relationships between Book and other entities like Author, Publisher etc using JPA. This will be used to perform CRUD operations and map to/from the database tables.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the Book entity and its relationships to map the database schema for the library application using JPA.\&quot;,\&quot;/LibraryApp/src/main/java/dev/patika/LibraryApp/repository/AuthorRepository.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines the AuthorRepository interface which is used to perform CRUD operations on Author entities in the database.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It extends JpaRepository which provides basic CRUD functionality out of the box.\\n\\n- It defines the entity type as Author and the primary key type as Long. \\n\\n- It defines a custom finder method findByNameAndBirthDateAndCountry to search for an Author by name, birthdate and country. This returns an Optional since the result may be null.\\n\\n- The @Repository annotation marks this interface as a repository, enabling auto wiring and other Spring Data features.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- save(Author author) - Saves an author \\n- findById(Long id) - Finds author by ID\\n- findAll() - Finds all authors\\n- delete(Author author) - Deletes an author\\n- findByNameAndBirthDateAndCountry - Custom finder method to search by multiple fields\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides the basic CRUD data access layer for Author entities using Spring Data JPA.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
